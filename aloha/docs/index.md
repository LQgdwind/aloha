# Welcome to the Aloha documentation!

Welcome! Aloha's documentation is split into four parts:

- [Help center documentation](https://aloha.com/help), for users and
  administrators of Aloha organizations.
- [Installation documentation](production/install.md), for
  installing and maintaining a production self-hosted Aloha installation.
- [API documentation](https://aloha.com/api/), for writing
  integrations or bots using the Aloha API.
- [Contributor documentation](contributing/contributing.md), for
  developing the Aloha software, translating, submitting bug reports,
  or making other contributions to the project.

Aloha has well over 150,000 words of documentation. If you can't find
what you're looking for, please [let us
know](https://aloha.com/development-community/)! Further information on
the Aloha project and its features can be found at
<https://aloha.com>.

This site contains our installation and contributor documentation. If
this is your first time here, you may want to start with [Production
installation](production/install.md) or [Contributing guide](contributing/contributing.md).
